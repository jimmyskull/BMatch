Generalized Matching Code
</div>

<p class=page> 
A command-line tool for solving <em>generalized matching</em> problems (a.k.a. <em>b-matchings</em>, or <em>degree-constrained subgraphs</em>) is available <a href="../pub/bmatch.tgz">here</a>.  The archive contains binaries for Linux and MacOSX.  There is also a precompiled MEX interface for Matlab.  To get started follow these instructions.  There's a <a href="../pub/README_bmatch">README</a> with more details if you have questions, or if things do not work as expected.

Usage> bmatch [-arg1 value] [-arg2 value] ...

Solves:
       optimize_Yij sum_ij W_ij Y_ij  s.t. l_i <= sum_j Y_ij <= u_i, 1 <= i <= n
       and Wij and Yij are symmetric

Arguments [with default values]:

            -w -weights [NULL] input file, NULL => std. input
            -d -degrees [NULL] input file, NULL => std. input
            -o -output  [NULL] output file, NULL => std. output
            -l -const_l [-1  ] positive integer, negative => std. input
            -u -const_u [-1  ] positive integer, negative => std. input
            -s -sparse  [0   ] 0 => matrix, 1 => IJW input format
            -m -method  [1   ] selects algorithm
            -v -verbose [0   ] positive integer

Algorithm: 

    1. exact maxwgt solution using goblin via subgraph complement
    2. exact mincost solution using goblin
    3. greedy 1/2 approximation to maxwgt solution
    4. greedy 1/2 approximation to maxwgt solution with recursion
    5. bipartite relaxation to maxwgt solution using belief propagation

Notes: 

       Self-loops are handled: a self-loop increases the degree of a node
       by 2.  Weights must be positive (Wij >= 0).  Edges with zero-weight
       (Wij==0) are not allowed to partake in the matching.

       If the weights, degrees or output file is not specified, then the
       corresponding input [output] data is entered in [written to] the
       display.  The format should match the examples given in the data
       directory.  Enter a blank line to terminate input of a given data.

       The output weight is calculated as sum_{i<=j} Wij Yij, except when
       beleif propagation is used, whose output is not necessarily symmetric.
       For BP, the output weight is 0.5 * sum_{i,j} Wij Yij.

       The lower bounds are ignored by methods 3-5. Bipartite relaxation
       assumes that the degree upper bounds can be met with equality.

    <b>example 3</b>: using the same matrix, try different -m solvers, e.g. the greedy algorithm (method 3) -- the greedy method is guaranteed to obtain >= 1/2 of the optimal weight, which from the previous example is known to be 34 -- belief propagation (method=5) treats variables Yij as edges in a directed bipartite graph between nodes 0..(N-1) and 0'..(N-1)' -- this can be viewed as a relaxation of the problem stated above -- in particular Yij=1 does not imply Yji=1, and there are no self-loops ... both idiosyncrasies are evident its solution

    <b>example 6</b>: this example demonstrates that the exact solution is NOT invariant to uniform weight increments or decrements -- consider the two problems that are solved below -- the second is identical to the first except that the weights are each incremented by 1 (the zero entries are preserved to exclude these edges from the solution) -- don't be alarmed by these running times, which are primarily due to my slow typing

    <b>example 7</b>: this example demonstrates the min-cost solver (method 2) and also shows how its solution relates to the max-weight solution -- the weights will be the same as in example 6, but new degree bounds are chosen following: LB' = DEG - UB and UB' = DEG - LB, where DEG is the degree in the candidate graph -- for example, since node 1 has LB = 0, UB = 1, and has 2 potential edges where Wij>0, therefore LB' = 2 - 1 = 1 and UB' = 2 - 0 = 2 -- notice how the solutions are complementary to those shown in example 6
